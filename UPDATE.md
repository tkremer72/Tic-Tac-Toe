# Added the following lines of code to project:
Inside the manifest.json file, I changed "sizes": "192x192" to "sizes":"16x15"
Inside of the package.json file, I added the following to the "devDependencies"     "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object": "^7.21.11"

Both of these got rid of console errors in chrome and in the vsc terminal.

Also swapped out the React favicon with my own personal favicon.ico
